    = Introduction

    The task consists in a binary classification problem, the goal is to perform fingerprint spoofing detection (i.e. to distinguish between real and fake fingerprints). 
    
    #box(height: 37pt)
    The dataset consists of 6 features. In this first part we will analyze some statistics of the dataset and the correlation between the features.

  == Features Compared

  === Features 1 and 2

  #image("imgs/hist/histograms_0.svg")

  When looking at the first feature we can observe that the classes overlap almost completely. The `Genuine` label has higher variance than the `Fake` class but the mean is similar. Both classes exhibit one mode in the histogram but the `Fake` class has a higher peak.

  #image("imgs/hist/histograms_1.svg")

  Looking at the second feature we can notice the opposite behavior. The `Fake` class has a higher variance than the `Genuine` class but the mean is similar. Both classes exhibit one mode in the histogram but 
  #v(400pt)
  the `Genuine` class has a higher peak. Again, the classes overlap almost completely.

  // #box(height: 10pt)
  === Features 3 and 4

  #image("imgs/hist/histograms_2.svg")

  Looking at the plot for the third class we can notice that the two features are much more distinct, they overlap slightly in 0. The `Genuine` class has a peak in -1 while the `Fake` class has a peak in 1. They both have similar mean and variance. One mode for each class is evident from the histogram.

  #image("imgs/hist/histograms_3.svg")

  The fourth feature shows similar characteristics to the third feature.

  == Features 5 and 6

  #image("imgs/hist/histograms_4.svg")

  The fifth feature also shows good distinction between the two classes with an overlap at the edges of the `Fake` class distribution. They exhibit similar variance but with a lower mean for the `Genuine` class. The `Fake` class peaks in 0 while the `Genuine` has two modes and peaks in -1 and 1.

  #image("imgs/hist/histograms_5.svg")

  The last feature shows similar characteristics to the fifth feature.

  #image("imgs/scatter/overlay_4_5.png")

  Looking at the scatter plot we see that there are four distinct clusters for each of the labels, they overlap slightly at the edges of each cluster.
